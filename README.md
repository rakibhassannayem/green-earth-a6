1) var: It is a function scope. Works everywhere inside a function. Can be updated and re-declared.
  let: Its a block scope. Works only in the scope{} where it declared. It can be updated but not re-deca
  const: Its a block scope like 'let' but it can not be updated.

2) map(): Does not return anything.
  forEach(): Returns a new array with the modifications we want.
  filter(): It also returns a new array based on condition we applied. It removes the elements that does not match our condition.

3) Arrow funtions in ES6 is just a shorter way to write function in JS. It does not need function keyword.

4) By destructuring we can get specific elements from an array or object and assign them in a variable. We
  can point them using the index number of that element.

5) Template literals in ES6 is a easier way to work with strings. By this it is easier to add variables in a
  string by using ${} but in concatenation it uses + . It uses backticks`` but in string concatenation quotation'' or "".
